# General parameters
project_name: metabarcoding_project

# Files to work with. Specify the extension, e.g. fastq.gz / fq.gz / fastq / fq.
# The default selects any of these
# Regular expression syntax is allowed.
# Only used if no custom sample table is given.
file_extension: "fastq.gz"

# Specify sequence orientation.
  # "fwd" = all sequences are expected to be in 5'-3' orientation.
  # "rev" = all sequences are expected to be in 3'-5' orientation.
  # "mixed" = the orientation of seqs is expected to be mixed (5'-3' and 3'-5)
  # "custom" = the orientation of different files is given in a custom sample table (see below)
  #   In this case there should be a column "orient" which has values "fwd", "rev", or "mixed"
  # if seqs are "mixed", but using "fwd" setting, then some valid seqs (or samples) will be lost.
  # if seqs are "fwd", but using "mixed", then ERROR.
orient: mixed

# Sample parameters
# custom primer trimming parameters per sample can be given as columns in the
# sample table.
custom_sample_table: FALSE

# Added reference sequences (leave blank or use NULL if none)
# "table" should be an Excel *.xlsx spreadsheet, with (at least) two columns in the
# first sheet:
#  Culture_ID: unique identifier for the sequence, muse _exactly_ match the sequence
#    name in "fasta"
#  Protax_synonym: comma-separated taxonomy string for the new ID, starting with
#    kingdom.  Be sure to match the taxonomy used by protax, including spelling!
#    e.g.: Fungi,Basidiomycota,Agaricomycetes,Russulales,Stereaceae,Conferticium_17349,Conferticium_ravum_412824

### parallelism settings ###
############################

# maximum number of ASV sequences to process in a single batch

# each sequencing run and orientation. 2 will yield maximum parallelism in most
# situations.
workers_per_seqrun: 2

# parallel jobs to run. For crew, the number of jobs actually launched may be
# less than min_jobs if additional jobs would have nothing to do.

### quality filtering settings ###

### tag-jumps filtering settings ###
####################################
# comment out this section or set tag_jump to FALSE to omit this step
tag_jump:
  f: 0.05             # expected cross-talk rate
  p: 1                # power to rise the exponent

###############################
### Amplicon model settings ###
###############################
# comment out this section or set model_type to "none" to skip this step
# statistical sequence models are used for several purposes:
#  1) aligning ASVs prior to use of protaxA and/or NuMt detection
#  2) filtering ASVs to remove spurious sequences
amplicon_model:
  model_type: CM      # allowed values are CM, HMM, and none
  model_file: data/ITS3_ITS4.cm

  # model filter will be skipped if amplicon_model$model_type is "none",
  # or if this section is commented out.
  # these values will need to be tuned for different amplicons/models
  model_filter:
    max_model_start: 5    # the match must start at this point in the model or earlier
    min_model_end: 140    # the match must end at this point in the model or later
    min_model_score: 50   # the match bit score must be at least this

  # producing aligned sequences will be skipped if the value is false

# Feature = ASV/OTU/x
repeats: "sum"     # what to to do with the samples that have the SAME NAME.
                    # "sum" = merging the replicates

#######################
### Protax settings ###
#######################
protax:
  aligned: no # "yes" assumes all reference and query sequences are aligned
  location: "protaxFungi" # directory where protax is
  #### Ranks ####
  # Ranks should be listed from most inclusive to lease inclusive.
  # The first rank(s) may be given with values (e.g. "- kingdom: Fungi" instead
  # of just "- kingdom"). This means that the rank(s) are not assigned by
  # Protax, but rather are assumed to already be known by Protax; i.e. they are
  # the root of the classification.
  ranks:
    - kingdom: Fungi
    - phylum
    - class
    - order
    - family
    - genus
    - species

###################################
### Outgroup reference settings ###
###################################
# The outgroup reference should be taxonomically annotated sequences which
# include not only the ingroup (i.e., those sequences which Protax can identify)
# but also (ideally) all other groups which could conceivably be encountered
# with the chosen marker.
# Optionally, the taxonomic annotations can be given in another file.
# (The formatting in this case is idiosyncratic, related to the release format
# of Unite.)
# If given, this is also the file used for reference-based chimera checking.
outgroup_reference:
  sequences: data/sh_matching_data/sanger_refs_sh.fasta
  taxonomy: data/sh_matching_data/shs_out.txt

###########################
### Clustering settings ###
###########################
cluster:
  #### dist_config ####
  # method for calculating pairwise distances during clustering
  # options for dist_config:method are "usearch" or any of the options available
  # for optimotu::dist_config(), as of now "hamming", "wfa2", "edlib", "hybrid",
  # or "usearch".  Additional options can be passed here as additional named
  # parameters.
  dist_config:
    - method: wfa2

  #### thresholds ####

  # A tsv file which must have columns "rank", "superrank", "supertaxon", and
  # "threshold". This gives the threshold to use for clustering sequences at the
  # given "rank" when they are already identified as belonging to the given
  # "supertaxon", which has rank "superrank".  For instance, clustering taxa at
  # species level when they are already identified as belonging to phylum
  # Ascomycota. Additional columns are ignored, except that, for
  # back-compatibility reasons, if a column named "reliability" is present,
  # then only entries where this column is equal to "plausible" is used.
  # If the option `cluster_optimize` is given (and does not evaluate to false)
  # then the `cluster_thresholds` file will not be read, but instead will be
  # (over)written with the new optimal thresholds.
  thresholds: metadata/12S_thresholds.tsv

  #### optimize ####
  # To skip optimization and use saved thresholds, set to `FALSE` or comment out
  # the entire section.
  optimize:
    #### train_data ####
    # should be either "reference", "self", or the name of a fasta
    # file (optionally gzipped) giving reference sequences with taxonomic
    # annotations. If "reference" then the same data is used for cluster
    # optimization as for taxonomic classification.  If "self" then sequences
    # from this study which are taxonomically identified with
    # confidence > min_conf are used for optimization.
    #
    # If a file then the sequences in the file are used.
    train_data: "../marco_bolo_challenge/"
    # min_conf is used only when train_data=="self". It gives the minimum
    # confidence for a taxonomic annotation to be used in threshold optimization
    min_conf: 0.5
    # dist_max and dist_step specify which thresholds should be tested.
    dist_max: 0.4
    dist_step: 0.001
